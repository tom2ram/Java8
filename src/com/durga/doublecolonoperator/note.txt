Method and Constructor Reference By using :: Operator
:: Double colon Operator --> we can use :: Operator for Method Reference and constructor Reference
without lambda expression we can define m1 method of functional interface by using method reference. 
only one condition is there both method having same arguments type. No matter about return type and modifier it can be same or diffrent.
Biggest advantage is code reusability.
Method Reference is alternative syntax to Lambda Expressions.
The target method can b static method or instance method.
Syntax for Method Reference -
	Static method
		classname :: target method name
		
	Non static (instance) Method
		Object reference :: target method name
		
Constructor Reference --> 
Constructor Reference is alternative syntax to Lambda Expressions.
without lambda expression we can define m1 method of functional interface by using method reference.
only one condition is there both method and Constructor having same arguments type. No matter about return type and modifier it can be same or diffrent.

Syntax for Constructor Reference - 
		classname :: new
